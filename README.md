_Financial metrics dashboard with a React + TypeScript frontend and a FastAPI backend._

## Recommended steps

1. Fork this repository to your account.
2. Open your fork in GitHub Codespaces or clone it and run it in your local environment.
3. Run your AI agent to inspect both frontend and backend.
4. Document the proposed rules and memory bank in your fork.
5. Refine and validate the rules until they fit the project's real workflow.

## Expected agents directory structure

```text
./.agents
└─ /rules
   └─ <rule-name>.md
└─ /skills
   └─ /<skill-name>
      └─ /SKILL.md
```

## How to run locally

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The frontend uses the Vite proxy for `/api` by default, so no extra environment variables are required in local development or Codespaces.
If you need to target a different backend origin, copy `frontend/.env.example` to `.env` and set `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

For the project-specific architecture, endpoints, tests, and contribution guidance, see [readme.afva.md](./readme.afva.md).

## Sample Data Source

The canonical sample movements come from `generate_mock_movements(seed=42)` in `backend/app/routes.py`; the dashboard consumes them through `GET /api/metrics`. There is no database and changes are not persisted. Avoid maintaining a second collection of sample movements in the frontend; tests may define small local fixtures.

Docker images install from the committed lockfiles: `npm ci` for the frontend and `pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt` for the backend.

The backend allows no CORS origins by default; in the normal workflow, Vite proxies `/api` to the backend from the same origin. If a browser must call the API directly from another origin, set `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated list of explicit origins.

Remote debugging is disabled by default. To enable it locally, use `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.debug.yml up --build`; port `5678` is bound only to `127.0.0.1`.
